This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Cycling training project of amateur cyclist.

## Environment

- **Python**: 3.14.3 (CPython)
- **Virtual environment**: `venv_p/` (activate with `source venv_p/bin/activate`)
- **IDE**: PyCharm

## Project Files

- `training_plan.md` — Overall plan: zones, 25-week periodization, weekly structure, strength plan, progress tracking, feedback format
- `plan/block_1_base_rebuild.md` — Weeks 1–4 detailed daily workouts with Intervals.icu format
- Future blocks will be added as `plan/block_N_*.md`

## Coaching Context

- **Event**: Pyrenees 2500km / ~70,000m, early August 2026
- **Schedule**: 5 cycling days + 2 strength days (double up strength AM + cycling PM for 1 full rest day)
- **Indoor platform**: Rouvy (workouts written in Intervals.icu text format)
- **Long rides**: Weekends (Sat/Sun)
- **No formal FTP tests** — track progress from training data and local climb benchmarks
- **Weekly feedback**: Athlete provides RPE, hours, fatigue ratings → coach adjusts next week

## Project details

I’d like you to become my new cycling coach and help me create a customized training plan. Below, I’ve added some details to guide you in designing a plan that fits my goals, timeline, and lifestyle:

- I’m an amateur cyclist, not a performance athlete, but I’m looking to improve.
- I want to analyze and plan trainings
- My time for training is limited, so I want a plan that prioritizes “bang for buck” workouts—maximizing results in the time I can commit.
- Format: Provide the plan as a diary with daily workouts, broken down into:
    - Indoor Workouts: Include a corresponding Rouvy workout in format https://forum.intervals.icu/t/workout-builder/1163.
    - Outdoor Rides: Keep these simple and enjoyable—no need for constant stat-checking
- Limit tests if it is possible. And try track progress from trainings 
- Let me know how to provide weekly feedback so you can adapt the plan as we go.
- Present the training plan in a table format for easy reference.
- Include clear descriptions of each workout and its purpose (e.g., endurance, power, recovery)
- Give me an indication of the metrics (e.g power, hard rate or exertion level) that the workout should be done at.

**Goals:**

1. My primary cycling goal is ultra endurance rides by mountains and improve my FTP to ride long climbs it good pace
2. My secondary cycling goal is to improve my 5 - 20 min power efforts to fly on local short climbs fast.
3. In middle summer I'm planing to ride 2500 km multiday self supported endurance ride by the Pyrenees with assent ~70000 meters   

**Current Fitness Level:**

1. I restarted my training 3 month ago. Before I had FTP 280 watts.
2. I currently cycle ~4 times per week and a total time of 3-4 per week. This my second week after pause.
3. In addition to cycling, I also do some workout training but not regular

**Limitations:**

1. I can dedicate about 15 hours to training outdoors. Or 8-10 indoors. I located in Gijon so you can check weather
2. I don’t like long zone 2 rides on indoor training and in general prefer outdoor, because indoor rides are boring
3. The equipment I have available includes road bike with power meter and pulse meter, interactive trainer

**Metrics:**

1. I track my rides with heart rate monitor and power meter and my typical stats are 260 FTP now (max FTP I ever gotten 278), heart rate  LT1: 130-132, LT2 ~160 max HR ~ 175, weight 76 kg height 170

**Likes/Dislikes:**

1. I enjoy  hilly rides, long rides, ultra endurance rides the most about cycling.
2. I struggle with or dislike flat rides but in my location currently hard to find flat routes. As negative on my hilly and mountain terrain It's hard to stick to zone 2 
3. I’m also interested in adding more structured workout sessions.
