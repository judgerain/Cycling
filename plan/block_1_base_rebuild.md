## Week 1 (Feb 9–15) — Re-Introduction | ~9h cycling + 1× strength

> **Data update (Feb 12, post-ride):** CTL 49.3, ATL 51.4, TSB -2. Three rides done (Tue–Thu). Thu indoor SS Ramps: 1h00, avg 193W, TSS 61, HR 136 — SS intervals hit 224-250W range as planned. Week on track: 4h52m / TSS 293 through Thu. Weekend rides remain.

| Day | Session | Duration | Description | Zones |
|-----|---------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Mon 9** | *(rest)* | — | No training | — |
| **Tue 10** | Outdoor ride (done) | 2h17 | Gijón hilly, NP 206W, TSS 141, 1079m elev | Z2 avg, HR 136 |
| **Wed 11** | Outdoor ride (done) | 1h34 | Caught weather window, NP 200W, TSS 91, 656m | Z2-Z3, HR 133 |
| **Thu 12** | Indoor: Sweet Spot Ramps 30min (done) | 1h00 | Zwift: "Sweet Spot Ramps - 30min" — 193W avg, TSS 61, HR 136 | Z2-Z4 |
| **Fri 13** | **REST** | — | Full rest. Recovery after 3 training days | — |
| **Sat 14** | Long outdoor ride | 2h30 | Hilly terrain, steady endurance | Z2 avg, HR < 145 |
| **Sun 15** | Moderate outdoor ride | 1h30 | Enjoy hills, moderate pace | Z2, occasional Z3 on climbs |
| **Sun 15** | Strength PM | 35min | Only strength session this week — don't skip | — |

> **Week total**: 2h17 + 1h34 + 1h00 (done) + 2h30 + 1h30 = ~8h51 cycling. 1× strength (Sun PM).

### Thursday — Sweet Spot Ramps 30min *(Zwift: "Sweet Spot Ramps - 30min")* | ~50 TSS

```
- Warmup 10m 55%

3x
- Ramp 10m 85-95% 90rpm
- Recovery 5m 65%

- Cooldown 5m 50%
```

**Purpose**: Progressive sweet spot ramps (224→250W). Each 10-minute block starts at low sweet spot and builds to upper sweet spot. The ramping format is more engaging than flat intervals and teaches pacing on climbs. 30 minutes total at sweet spot — a gentle intro after your outdoor rides this week.

## Week 2 (Feb 16–22) — Building Rhythm | ~10h cycling + 2× strength

| Day | Session | Duration | Description | Zones |
|-----|---------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Mon 16** | Strength AM | 35min | Lower body + core | — |
| **Mon 16** | Easy spin PM (indoor) | 40min | Z1 flush ride | Z1 |
| **Tue 17** | Indoor: Sweet Spot 12 | 65m | Zwift: "Sweet Spot 12" — 2×12m SS + VO2 finishers | Z3-Z5 (see workout) |
| **Wed 18** | Easy outdoor/indoor ride | 60m | Z2 ride, keep it conversational | Z2, HR < 142 |
| **Thu 19** | Indoor: Over-Unders | 66m | Zwift: "Over-Unders & Over-ATS" — lactate clearance | Z3-Z4 (see workout) |
| **Fri 20** | **REST** | — | Full rest | — |
| **Sat 21** | Long outdoor ride | 3h00 | Endurance in hills, steady effort. Bring food | Z2 avg, HR < 145 |
| **Sun 22** | Moderate outdoor ride | 1h45 | Include 2-3 climbs at moderate pace | Z2-Z3 |
| **Sun 22** | Strength PM | 35min | Lower body + core, afternoon session | — |

> **Week total**: ~40m + 1h05 + 1h + 1h06 + 3h + 1h45 = ~8h36 cycling + 2× strength.

### Tuesday — Sweet Spot 12 *(Zwift: "Sweet Spot 12")* | ~70 TSS

```
- Warmup 10m 55%
- 5m 75%
- 12m 91%
- 3m 55%
- 12m 91%
- 3m 55%

4x
- Work 1m 106%
- Recovery 2m 55%

- Cooldown 5m 50%
```

**Purpose**: 24 minutes sustained at sweet spot (239W) — a step up from Week 1's ramps. The 4×1min @ 106% (278W) finishers when fatigued push your VO2max ceiling and prepare you for harder work in later weeks. Should feel tough but completable.

### Thursday — Over-Unders & Over-ATS *(Zwift: "Over-Unders & Over-ATS")* | ~66 TSS

```
- Warmup 10m 55%
- 5m 75%

3x
- Under 2m 85%
- Over 1m 100%
- Under 2m 85%
- Over 1m 100%
- Under 2m 85%
- Over 1m 100%
- Recovery 5m 55%

- Cooldown 6m 50%
```

**Purpose**: Classic over-under intervals — 27 minutes of accumulated work across 3 big blocks. Each block has 3 reps of 2min at 85% (224W) then 1min at FTP (263W). Teaches your body to clear lactate while sustaining effort. The repeated zone transitions are exactly what you'll face on rolling Pyrenees terrain. RPE should be 7-8/10 by the final block.

## Week 3 (Feb 23 – Mar 1) — Biggest Week of Block | ~12h cycling + 2× strength

| Day | Session | Duration | Description | Zones |
|-----|---------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Mon 23** | Strength AM | 35min | Lower body + core (add slight load increase) | — |
| **Mon 23** | Easy spin PM (indoor) | 40m | Z1 flush | Z1 |
| **Tue 24** | Indoor: Sweet Spot Pyramid 50min | 72m | Zwift: "Sweet Spot Pyramid - 50min" — 5×10m SS | Z3-Z4 (see workout) |
| **Wed 25** | Outdoor ride with tempo | 1h30 | Include 2×12m tempo on climbs | Z2 with Z3 efforts |
| **Thu 26** | Indoor: Norseman Geilo | 67m | Zwift: "Norseman: Geilo" — progressive climbing ramps | Z2-Z5 (see workout) |
| **Fri 27** | **REST** | — | Full rest | — |
| **Sat 28** | Long outdoor ride | 3h30 | Longest ride of block. Hilly terrain, pack food | Z2 avg |
| **Sun 1** | Moderate outdoor ride | 2h00 | Moderate hills, back-to-back endurance after Sat | Z2 |
| **Sun 1** | Strength PM | 35min | Lower body + core, afternoon session | — |

> **Week total**: ~40m + 1h12 + 1h30 + 1h07 + 3h30 + 2h = ~10h19 cycling. Target ~12h — extend Sat/Sun if legs feel good.

### Tuesday — Sweet Spot Pyramid 50min *(Zwift: "Sweet Spot Pyramid - 50min")* | ~84 TSS

```
- Warmup 10m 55%
- 10m 88% 90rpm
- 2m 55%
- 10m 90% 90rpm
- 2m 55%
- 10m 91% 90rpm
- 2m 55%
- 10m 93% 90rpm
- 2m 55%
- 10m 93% 90rpm
- Cooldown 5m 50%
```

**Purpose**: **50 minutes total at sweet spot** — the biggest SS accumulation of the block. Pyramid builds from 88% (231W) to 93% (245W) across 5 blocks. At 90rpm cadence throughout. This is where real aerobic adaptation happens. Should feel like a sustained hard effort but never desperate. If the last 2 blocks feel impossible, drop to 88%.

### Thursday — Norseman: Geilo *(Zwift: "Norseman: Geilo")* | ~70 TSS

```
- Warmup 10m 55%

4x
- Approach 4m 65%
- Tempo 3m 81%
- Threshold 2m 95%
- VO2 1m 109%
- Sprint 30s 125%
- Recovery 2m30s 50%

- Cooldown 5m 50%
```

**Purpose**: 4 progressive climbing ramps — each 10m30s effort simulates a real climb that gets steeper toward the summit. You start at 65% (171W) and build through tempo, threshold, VO2max, finishing with a 30s surge at 125% (329W). 42 minutes of total climbing work across 4 repeats. This is the hardest Thursday session of the block — RPE 8-9/10 on the final ramp. Trains pacing discipline and climbing power across all zones.

## Week 4 (Mar 2–8) — Recovery Week | ~7h cycling + 1× strength (light)

**Drop volume ~40%, drop intensity. Let adaptations happen.**

| Day | Session | Duration | Description | Zones |
|-----|---------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Mon 2** | Light strength (optional) | 25min | Reduce weight, focus on mobility + core | — |
| **Mon 2** | Easy spin (indoor) | 30m | Very easy | Z1 |
| **Tue 3** | Indoor: Red Day Recovery | 45m | Zwift: "EF Red Day" — light cadence drills | Z1-Z2 (see workout) |
| **Wed 4** | Easy outdoor/indoor ride | 50m | Easy spin, enjoy | Z2, HR < 140 |
| **Thu 5** | Easy outdoor ride | 60m | No agenda, just ride | Z2, HR < 140 |
| **Fri 6** | **REST** | — | Full rest | — |
| **Sat 7** | Moderate outdoor ride | 2h00 | Shorter than previous weeks, relaxed pace | Z2 |
| **Sun 8** | Easy outdoor ride | 1h00 | Spin out, prepare for next block | Z1-Z2 |

> **Week total**: ~30m + 45m + 50m + 1h + 2h + 1h = ~6h05 cycling. Recovery week — no hard efforts.

### Tuesday — EF Red Day Recovery *(Zwift: "EF Pro Cycling's Red Day")* | ~30 TSS

```
- Warmup 10m 55%

4x
- Spin 4m 75% 100rpm
- Recovery 3m 50% 85rpm

- Cooldown 7m 50%
```

**Purpose**: Active recovery with high-cadence drills. The 4×4min @ 75% (197W) at 100rpm keeps legs spinning and promotes blood flow without creating training stress. Cadence focus improves pedaling efficiency. Should feel effortless — if it doesn't, you need more rest.

## Block 1 Progress Markers

By the end of Week 4, you should notice:
- Rides at 197W (Z2 ceiling) feel comfortable, HR stays below 142
- Sweet spot (231-248W) is sustainable for 12+ minutes without distress
- 10-12h weeks feel manageable without excessive fatigue
- If FTP feels like it may have increased, ride a local climb hard (15-20min) and note power/HR

## What's Next: Block 2 (Base Build)

Block 2 (Weeks 5-8) will:
- Push volume to 10-13h/week
- Extend sweet spot intervals to 15-20min (Zwift: "Sub Threshold #4", "XX SST 2×20min")
- Add dedicated climbing repeat sessions (Zwift: "Norseman: Geilo", "Gentle Squeeze")
- Longer weekend rides (3.5-4h+)
- Weather improves in March → shift to more outdoor riding
- Introduce back-to-back weekend long rides
