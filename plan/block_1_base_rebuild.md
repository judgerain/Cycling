# Block 1: Base Rebuild (Weeks 1–4)

**Dates**: Feb 9 – Mar 8, 2026
**Goal**: Re-adapt to structured training, rebuild aerobic base, introduce sweet spot
**Volume**: 9h → 10h → 12h → 7h (recovery week)

> **Gijón February weather**: Expect 6–14°C, frequent rain (~15 rain days), windy. Plan for mostly indoor during the week, outdoor on dry days. Check forecast daily and swap indoor/outdoor as needed. Weather improves into March.

## Week 1 (Feb 9–15) — Re-Introduction | ~9h cycling + 2× strength

> **Data update (Feb 11, post-ride):** CTL 49.7, ATL 53.8, TSB -4. Two outdoor rides done (Tue + Wed). Wed ride: 1h34m, NP 200W, IF 0.76, TSS 91, 656m elev, HR 133 avg — natural tempo from terrain. Strength skipped Wed. Thu becomes the one structured indoor session this week.

| Day | Session | Duration | Description | Zones |
|-----|---------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Mon 9** | *(rest)* | — | No training | — |
| **Tue 10** | Outdoor ride (done) | 2h17 | Gijón hilly, NP 206W, TSS 141, 1079m elev | Z2 avg, HR 136 |
| **Wed 11** | Outdoor ride (done) | 1h34 | Caught weather window, NP 200W, TSS 91, 656m | Z2-Z3, HR 133 |
| **Thu 12** | Indoor: Sweet Spot Intro | 60min | Key structured session of the week — don't skip | Z2-Z4 (see workout) |
| **Fri 13** | **REST** | — | Full rest. Recovery after 3 training days | — |
| **Sat 14** | Long outdoor ride | 2h30 | Hilly terrain, steady endurance | Z2 avg, HR < 145 avg |
| **Sun 15** | Moderate outdoor ride | 1h30 | Enjoy hills, moderate pace | Z2, occasional Z3 on climbs |
| **Sun 15** | Strength PM | 35min | Only strength session this week — don't skip | — |

> **Week total**: 2h17 + 1h34 (done) + 1h SS + 2h30 + 1h30 = ~9h21 cycling. 1× strength (Sun PM).

### Thursday — Sweet Spot Intro

```
- 10m 55%
- 3x
  - 6m 88%
  - 4m 55%
- 5m 55%
- 2x
  - 4m 90%
  - 3m 55%
- 5m 50%
```

**Purpose**: Introduce sweet spot (88-90% FTP, 231-237W). Short intervals to get body used to this intensity. Should feel "comfortably hard". Your hilly outdoor rides gave natural Z3 tempo work; this session targets sustained power above tempo. Your Rossfeld ride (NP 249W, IF 0.95) shows you can handle this.

## Week 2 (Feb 16–22) — Building Rhythm | ~10h cycling + 2× strength

| Day | Session | Duration | Description | Zones |
|-----|---------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Mon 16** | Strength AM | 35min | Lower body + core | — |
| **Mon 16** | Easy spin PM (indoor) | 40min | Z1 flush ride | Z1 |
| **Tue 17** | Indoor: Sweet Spot Development | 75min | Longer SS intervals — extending time at 88-92% | Z4-low (see workout) |
| **Wed 18** | Easy outdoor/indoor ride | 60min | Z2 ride, keep it conversational | Z2, HR < 142 |
| **Thu 19** | Indoor: Over-Under Intro | 75min | First over-unders to build lactate clearance | Z3-Z4 (see workout) |
| **Fri 20** | **REST** | — | Full rest | — |
| **Sat 21** | Long outdoor ride | 3h00 | Endurance in hills, steady effort. Bring food | Z2 avg, HR < 145 |
| **Sun 22** | Moderate outdoor ride | 1h45 | Include 2-3 climbs at moderate pace | Z2-Z3 |
| **Sun 22** | Strength PM | 35min | Lower body + core, afternoon session | — |

> **Week total**: ~40min + 1h15 + 1h + 1h15 + 3h + 1h45 = ~9h55 cycling.

### Tuesday — Sweet Spot Extended

```
- 10m 55%
- 12m 88%
- 5m 55%
- 12m 90%
- 5m 55%
- 10m 92%
- 4m 55%
- 5m 50%
```

**Purpose**: 34 minutes total at sweet spot. Longer blocks build FTP without the mental drain of threshold work. Target 231-242W.

### Thursday — Over-Under Introduction

```
- 10m 55%
- 5m 75%
- 3m 55%
- 3x
  - 3m 92%
  - 1m 105%
  - 3m 88%
  - 3m 55%
- 5m 50%
```

**Purpose**: Over-unders teach your body to clear lactate while maintaining effort — exactly what you need on rolling climbs. The "over" (105%, ~276W) is brief; the "under" (88%, ~231W) is where you recover while still working.

## Week 3 (Feb 23 – Mar 1) — Biggest Week of Block | ~12h cycling + 2× strength

| **Mon 23** | Easy spin PM (indoor) | 40min | Z1 flush | Z1 |
| **Tue 24** | Indoor: Sweet Spot Progression | 75min | 3×12min SS with shorter rest | Z4-low (see workout) |
| **Wed 25** | Outdoor ride with tempo | 1h30 | Include 2×12min tempo on climbs | Z2 with Z3 efforts |
| **Thu 26** | Indoor: Climbing Threshold | 75min | Threshold repeats simulating climbs | Z4 (see workout) |

| **Sun 1** | Moderate outdoor ride | 2h00 | Moderate hills, back-to-back endurance after Sat | Z2 |
| **Sun 1** | Strength PM | 35min | Lower body + core, afternoon session | — |

> **Week total**: ~40min + 1h15 + 1h30 + 1h15 + 3h30 + 2h = ~10h10 cycling. Target ~12h — extend Sat/Sun if legs feel good.

### Tuesday — Sweet Spot 3×12

```
- 10m 55%
- 12m 90%
- 4m 55%
- 12m 90%
- 4m 55%
- 12m 92%
- 3m 55%
- 5m 50%
```

**Purpose**: 36 minutes total at sweet spot. This is where real FTP adaptation starts. Pushing interval length toward 12-15min.

### Thursday — Climbing Threshold Repeats

```
- 10m 55%
- 5m 75%
- 2m 55%
- 4x
  - 5m 100%

## Week 4 (Mar 2–8) — Recovery Week | ~7h cycling + 1× strength (light)

**Drop volume ~40%, drop intensity. Let adaptations happen.**

| Day | Session | Duration | Description | Zones |
|-----|---------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Mon 2** | Light strength (optional) | 25min | Reduce weight, focus on mobility + core | — |
| **Mon 2** | Easy spin (indoor) | 30min | Very easy | Z1 |
| **Tue 3** | Indoor: Openers | 50min | Short, snappy efforts to stay sharp | Z2 + sprints (see workout) |
| **Wed 4** | Easy outdoor/indoor ride | 50min | Easy spin, enjoy | Z2, HR < 140 |
| **Thu 5** | Easy outdoor ride | 60min | No agenda, just ride | Z2, HR < 140 |
| **Fri 6** | **REST** | — | Full rest | — |
| **Sat 7** | Moderate outdoor ride | 2h00 | Shorter than previous weeks, relaxed pace | Z2 |
| **Sun 8** | Easy outdoor ride | 1h00 | Spin out, prepare for next block | Z1-Z2 |

> **Week total**: ~30min + 50min + 50min + 1h + 2h + 1h = ~6h10 cycling. Recovery week — no hard efforts.

### Tuesday — Recovery Week Openers

```
- 10m 55%
- 10m 65%
- 4x
  - 30s 130%
  - 2m 50%
- 10m 65%
- 5m 50%
```

**Purpose**: Keep neuromuscular system engaged without building fatigue. The 30s sprints at 130% (~342W) are short enough to not create training load but keep legs "remembered" to go fast.

## Block 1 Progress Markers

By the end of Week 4, you should notice:
- Rides at 197W (Z2 ceiling) feel comfortable, HR stays below 142
- Sweet spot (231-248W) is sustainable for 12+ minutes without distress
- 10-12h weeks feel manageable without excessive fatigue
- If FTP feels like it may have increased, ride a local climb hard (15-20min) and note power/HR

## What's Next: Block 2 (Base Build)

Block 2 (Weeks 5-8) will:
- Push volume to 10-13h/week
- Extend sweet spot intervals to 15-20min
- Add dedicated climbing repeat sessions (6-8min at FTP)
- Longer weekend rides (3.5-4h+)
- Weather improves in March → shift to more outdoor riding
- Introduce back-to-back weekend long rides
